// redux actions

// We need a way to describe state changes in our application. We'll use actions for this.
// Actions are payloads of information that send an instruction on what type of transformation to make to your application’s state
// as well as any other relevant information. That's basically a fancy way of saying "an action is an object which describes what sort
// of transformation you want to make to your state.". An object makes up a perfect data structure for an action since it can perfectly
// describe the type of event which occurred in your application.

// One thing to note is that actions must have a type property to specify, well, the “type” of action which is occurring. Other than ‘type’,
// the structure of the action is up to you.

// action type
